How Do I Interpret User Needs and Incorporate Them Into a Program?
I start by gathering clear, specific requirements from stakeholders, which are then translated into user stories that describe the desired functionality from the user’s perspective. Going with this approach ensures that each feature is directly tied to a real-world need or goal. During development, frequent check-ins can help confirm that those needs are accurately reflected in the evolving software.

How Does Creating “User Stories” Help?
User stories break down high-level requirements into manageable, testable tasks that are easy to understand. Each story outlines who needs a particular feature, what they need, and why it’s important. This format keeps development focused on delivering tangible value and makes it easier to prioritize features, estimate workload, and confirm that the final product meets user expectations.

How Do I Approach Developing Programs, and Which Processes Do I Incorporate?
I use an Agile methodology, particularly Scrum, which emphasizes iterative development and frequent feedback. This involves sprint planning to select user stories, daily scrums to address obstacles, sprint reviews to demonstrate completed work, and retrospectives to refine the process. Additionally, I leverage test-driven development to ensure that each feature meets its acceptance criteria and that changes can be integrated with minimal disruption.

What Do I Do to Improve Future Development Work?
In future projects, I plan to continue refining these Agile and Scrum practices as this was my first in depth experience. This is going to include writing more precise user stories with clear acceptance criteria, involving stakeholders earlier and more often for feedback, and maintaining consistent testing practices. By combining these approaches, I can adapt to changing requirements quickly and keep the project aligned with user needs.
